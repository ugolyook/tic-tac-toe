## Tic-tac-toe

There are two players, each taking turns making a move. 
If either of the two results reaches 3:1 or 3:2, the player wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

They play one game, then the question of whether to continue is asked. 
If both **players** agree, it's ok; if even one player disagrees, it's over.
